# CodeIgniter MongoDB Library
### ALL-IN-ONE library for MongoDB
by [Dmitriy Verkhoumov](https://github.com/verkhoumov)

This library is based on a brand new PHP 7.0 to work with CodeIgniter 
since version 3 and MongoDB since version 3.2.

I have implemented the following main functions MongoDB:
select, insert, update, delete and aggregate documents; execute commands.

## The library is in the final stages of development.
